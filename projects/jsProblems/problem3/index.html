              <p>
                Create a game where the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100. A user will attempt to guess the number and only have 7 attempts. On each guess you will provide a response to guide the userâ€™s next guess. Modify the program so that the user is only allowed to enter a valid number between 1 and 100.

                Use some simple nested for loops to generate all possible coordinates from (0,0) up to (5,5). Your output must appear in rows and columns like mine. Modify the program to allow a user to enter the end coordinates.

              </a>
              <p>
                Use nested for loops to find four positive integers whose sum is 45, and such that the first plus 2, the second minus 2, the third multiplied by 2, and the fourth divided by 2 are all equal. Please note that these four numbers are integers, and not necessarily just digits. In this problem, we are no longer finding a single four-digit number; we are finding four separate numbers. However, since we are trying to generate all possible combinations, the procedure should be the same.
